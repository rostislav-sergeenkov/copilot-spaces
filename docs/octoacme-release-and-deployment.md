## Rollback & Incident Playbook

If a deployment fails or causes a critical issue:

1. **Trigger incident response**: Notify on-call and incident response team immediately
2. **Execute rollback**: Revert to last known-good release using documented rollback plan (version control, container registry, or infrastructure-as-code)
3. **Verify rollback**: Run smoke tests to confirm system is stable and functioning correctly
4. **Communicate status**: Update stakeholders on incident status, impact, and expected resolution timeline
5. **Triage root cause**: Conduct post-incident review to identify root cause and contributing factors
6. **Document action items**: Capture learnings and create action items to prevent recurrence

**Rollback procedures should be**:
- Documented and tested before each release
- Executable within 15 minutes for critical services
- Validated in staging environment periodically
